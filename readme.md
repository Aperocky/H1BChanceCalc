# H1B Chance for Applicants with US Master Degree

On 11/30/2018, White House proposed new H1B rules for lottery. In summary, this changed order of the 2 lotteries currently existing. Previously, applicants with US Master Degree or higher are selected first in a restrictive lottery of 20000 before they move on to general lottery, if unselected. Now, applicants with US Master Degree will first go through the general lottery before joining the restrictive lottery of 20000 if they're not selected. How does this affect chances for those who are applying with US Master Degree? Find out here:
